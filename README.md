#FEWD Week #4: CSS Layouts

---

###Description 

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](design_file) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the [design file](starter_code/readme) and according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use a background image for the headers
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-element


#### Bonus
- Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment
